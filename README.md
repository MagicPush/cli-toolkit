# Cliff â€” a CLI framework for PHP

Cliff allows you to write CLI scripts in PHP with comfort.
The main features are:

  * Arguments/options parser
  * Terse chained-call configuration syntax
  * No-config mode
  * Automatic bash completion
  * Usage and help generation
  * Validation and callbacks for args
  * Exception handling

The basic idea of Cliff is to allow you to work with CLI arguments exactly the same way
you work with http request variables: by using `$_REQUEST`. All you need is to describe
options and parameters of your script, and then everything just works. In no-config mode,
you don't event have to describe anything.

## HOWTO

You may want to look at scripts in `examples` directory, or even simply grab one of those
and modify to your needs.

A short example:

    <?php
    require_once 'cliff/lib/Cliff.php';
    use \cliff\Cliff;

    Cliff::run(Cliff::config()->many_params('lines'));

    foreach($_REQUEST['lines'] as $arg)
    {
        echo "$arg\n";
    }
    ?>

This little script will take arbitrary number of arguments and output each of them
on a separate line. Now, if you want to add an option to uppercase the arguments
before outputting them, it can be done quite easily:

    <?php
    require_once 'cliff/lib/Cliff.php';
    use \cliff\Cliff;

    Cliff::run(
        Cliff::config()
        ->flag('--uppercase -u') // adds --uppercase and -u as its alias
        ->many_params('lines')
    );

    foreach($_REQUEST['lines'] as $arg)
    {
        if($_REQUEST['uppercase'])    // this will be FALSE if the flag is not set,
            $arg = strtoupper($arg);  // so you don't have to worry about notices

        echo "$arg\n";
    }
    ?>

Now our script may be called as `php script.php -u abc def`. If called without arguments
or with incorrect ones, the script will show a short description of available options and
parameters. 'Parameter' in Cliff means any non-option argument.

Read phpdoc comments in `lib/Config.php` for all configuration possibilities.

## NO-CONFIG MODE

No-config mode allows you to have your cake and eat it too: you get $_REQUEST filling
for easy work, but don't have to configure anything.

    <?php
    require_once 'cliff/lib/Cliff.php';
    \cliff\Cliff::run();

    // work with $_REQUEST as you like:
    // -x will become $_REQUEST['x'] == true
    // --option will become $_REQUEST['option'] == true
    // --option=a will become $_REQUEST['option'] == 'a'
    // non-options will be accumulated in $_REQUEST['args'] array

You can always add configuration later, to enable proper help, validation and bash completion.

## BASH COMPLETION

Currently there is only basic completion for configured options. To enable it, run your script
with --cliff-bash-profile=alias option and add the output into .profile (or .bash_profile,
whatever the name is on your system).

    $ php awesometool.php --cliff-bash-profile=atool
    alias atool='php /path/to/your/awesometool.php'
    complete -o bashdefault -o default -C 'php /path/to/your/awesometool.php --cliff-complete--' atool

In this example:
 * awesometool.php is your cliff script
 * atool is the alias you will use to execute the awesome tool

After editing the profile, source it (or simply log off and on), and atool <tab> should
start working. Well, currently, only atool -<tab>, because only options are supported atm.

If you do not have php binary in your PATH, you should replace 'php' there by full filename.

## NOTES

You can use Cliff to add bash completion to any other program. Simply create a cliff script
with nothing but config and completion callbacks, and set the actual program name
when installing the completion into bash profile. Like this:

    complete -o bashdefault -o default -C "/usr/bin/php /path/to/your/phpunit-cliff.php --cliff-complete--" phpunit

To signal an error in your script, simply throw an exception. It will be caught by Cliff,
its message will be displayed into stderr, and the script will exit with non-zero status
(useful for shell scripting).

To change error exit code, you need to change Cliff::$error_exit_code. Default error exit code is 1.

## REQUIREMENTS

The only thing Cliff requires is PHP 5.3.

## TODO

If you don't mind, I'll leave this todo list here.

  * [+] Modifying option values and params via validator callbacks
  * [+] Special class for argument-related exceptions, so we can show usage only for those
  * [+] Specifying default error exit code somewhere (for grep-like exit codes)
  * [+] Separate options and flags
  * [+] A way to specify required options and options that require a value but provide default one
  * [+] Ability to allow unconfigured options
  * [+] Non-config mode: aggregate all provided options and store all params into $_REQUEST['args'],
    no validation or anything; could be useful for tmp scripts (hack a tool together with no design
    planning and then, when it matures, configure it for usage and completion)
  * [+] A way to specify optional parameters (e.g. vmig db [table])
  * [+] Non-validation parse time callbacks (to prevent --help from breaking completion)
  * Bash completion for options and params
    * [+] Completion for options
    * Completion for params
    * Completion for option values
    * Aliases when installing completion into bash profile (like g='script' x='script -a -b')
    * A nice way to install completion handlers into the profile
  * Ability to specify default values for single-letter options
  * Allow a string instead of $props array
  * Helper for colors
  * Helper for reading (char, string, password, stdin)
  * Helper for writing (out, err, interface = skipped if not tty, table)
  * Ability to store STDIN in a variable (is it possible to iterate over it instead?)
  * Ability to design complex subcommand structures via branches and subcommands
    (to distinguish branches we can just forbid two consequent branches with no params)
    * Adopting external commands as subcommands
    * Adopting external Cliff scripts as subcommands with usage/completion import
      * Load config from Cliff XML (not sure if PEAR::Console_CommandLine format is enough)
      * Generate config in Cliff XML
  * Load config from PEAR::Console_CommandLine XML
  * Option defined as '-ab' should have name 'a', not 'ab'
